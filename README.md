# GeoSense
A simple web app for exploring British Geological Survey (BGS) geoscientific IoT data

### Challenges:
- The total number of data points available for consumption is over 7 million so to avoid being rate limited or causing long wait times careful consideration must be given to how the data is fetched and displayed
- The optimal relationships to fetch all features of interest and then all the related datastreams from the BGS API are not directly available so some data manipulation is required

### Known Issues:
- When selecting some datastreams, 2 separate queries are made instead of 1. Requires investigation...
- Sorting observations by date is not working as expected. Requires investigation...

### Features:
- Display a list of features of interest (filtered to exclude features without datastreams)
- Display a list of datastreams for a selected feature of interest
- Display the min, max, mean and number of observations for a selected datastream
- Display a graph of the observations for a selected datastream over time
- Dark mode / theme switcher (I couldn't help myself ðŸ˜…)

### Non-functional:
- Caching of API data to reduce load times (thanks React Query!)

### Future Improvements:
- Increase test coverage to 80% or more
- Allow users to select a particular year / month to view observations for (would aid in reducing the number of observations fetched)
- Optimise data fetching by only selecting required fields in query to reduce API data egress and load times
- Add Google Maps API for location display ([3d Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/3d-maps-getting-started?hl=en))

### API Structure:
A visual representation of the relationships between the main entities in the BGS API:
- `FeaturesOfInterest`: A feature about which observations are made
- `Things`: Real-world sensors that can be integrated into communication networks
- `Observations`: Individual measurements recorded at a given point in time
- `Datastreams`: The properties observed by a thing, and the type of sensor making the observations
- `ObservedProperty`: Dictionary of properties being observed
